# WebCrawler
**Overview
**
This is a learning project where I explored web scraping using Python and the Scrapy framework. The goal of this project was to extract data from a website called "Books to Scrape" (https://books.toscrape.com/) and save the scraped information for further analysis.

**Project Details
**
Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scrapy library (install using pip install scrapy)
  
Learning Objectives
In this project, I focused on the following learning objectives:

- Understanding the basics of web scraping and its applications.
- Familiarizing myself with the Scrapy framework, a powerful tool for web scraping.
- Setting up a Scrapy spider to crawl through a website and extract desired information.
- Utilizing CSS selectors to target specific elements on web pages for scraping.
- Storing the scraped data in a structured format (JSON) for further analysis.

Project Structure
The project mainly consists of the following components:

webcrawler.py: This is the Python script that contains the Scrapy spider implementation.
output.json: The output file where the scraped data is saved.

Data Scraped
For each book on the website, I extracted the following information:

"title": The title of the book.
"price": The price of the book.
"avail": The availability status of the book.

*This learning project was conducted strictly for educational purposes, on a demo website that is built for web scraping purposes, to understand web scraping concepts and Python frameworks.*
